## 1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?
answer: Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 28×28 grayscale images of clothes like shirts, shoes, and bags, used for training and testing machine learning models.

## 2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?
answer: We normalize pixel values to make training faster and help the model learn more accurately.

## 3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.
answer: The Flatten layer converts the image into a single list, the Dense layer learns patterns, and the Output layer gives the final prediction.

## 4. What does an epoch mean in model training?
answer: An epoch means one complete pass of all training data through the model.

## 5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.
answer: If the predicted label matches the actual label, the model is correct; if not, the prediction is wrong.

## 6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?
answer: Accuracy can be improved by training longer, adding more layers, or using a better model like a CNN.
